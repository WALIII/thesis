This body of work is comprised of a few bricks of success held together by a hidden mortar made from countless failures. Every result described in this thesis was accomplished with the help and support of fellow lab mates and collaborators. Especially I would like to thank Jeff Markowitz, Greg Guitchounts, and Daniel Leman.

I received tremendous support from my thesis committee- especially Ian Davison and Alberto Cruz-Martin. I want to thank my advisor Tim Gardner for teaching me how to think- really, helping me learn how to exercise some control over how and what to think, to balance exploration with being a finisher. Being conscious and aware enough to choose what to pay attention to and to choose how to construct meaning from experience. 

I want to thank my friends in Biology, and the Graduate program in Neuroscience- to Shelly and Sandi especially- for letting a wayward soul into the fold. 

Finally, I am blessed to have an amazing, talented family who not only provided unwavering support, but also surprisingly fruitful scientific collaborations and insight.
