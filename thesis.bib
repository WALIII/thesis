              other sounds and recognize the vocalizations of individuals. To
              identify neural mechanisms for the discrimination of such natural
              sounds, we compared the linear spectro-temporal tuning properties
              of auditory midbrain and forebrain neurons in zebra finches with
              the statistics of natural sounds, including song. Here, we
              demonstrate that ensembles of auditory neurons are tuned to
              auditory features that enhance the acoustic differences between
              classes of natural sounds, and among the songs of individual
              birds. Tuning specifically avoids the spectro-temporal
              modulations that are redundant across natural sounds and
              therefore provide little information; rather, it overlaps with
              the temporal modulations that differ most across sounds. By
              comparing the real tuning and a less selective model of
              spectro-temporal tuning, we found that the real modulation tuning
              increases the neural discrimination of different sounds.
              Additionally, auditory neurons discriminate among zebra finch
              song segments better than among synthetic sound segments.",

              subpopulations with other response properties. To quantify the
              relative contributions of these different subpopulations in the

              across the neuronal population using a representative ensemble of

              a method for which single-unit isolation does not depend on
              neuronal activity, to quantify the fraction of neurons engaged by
              acoustic stimuli (tones, frequency modulated sweeps, white-noise
              bursts, and natural stimuli) in the primary auditory cortex of
              awake head-fixed rats. We find that the population response is
              sparse, with stimuli typically eliciting high firing rates (>20
              spikes/second) in less than 5\% of neurons at any instant. Some
              neurons had very low spontaneous firing rates (<0.01
              spikes/second). At the other extreme, some neurons had driven
              rates in excess of 50 spikes/second. Interestingly, the overall

              relevance of inferred internal copy circuits has remained
              unclear. One class of spinal interneurons implicated in the
              control of mammalian forelimb movement, cervical propriospinal

              stretch and compress proportionally less than gaps, whereas
              syllable-syllable and gap-gap correlations are significantly
              stronger than syllable-gap correlations. There is also increased
              temporal variability at motif boundaries and especially strong
              positive correlations between the same syllables sung in
              different motifs. Finally, we find evidence that syllable onsets
              may have a special role in aligning syllables with global song
              structure. Generally, the timing data support a hierarchical view
              in which song is composed of smaller syllable-based units and
              provide a rich set of constraints for interpreting the results of
              physiological recordings.",

              a major role in motor control and learning. Four main classes of
              striatal neuron are thought to be essential for normal striatal
              function: medium spiny neurons, fast-spiking interneurons,
              cholinergic tonically active neurons, and low-threshold spiking
              interneurons. However, the nature of the interaction of these
              neurons during behavior is poorly understood. The songbird area X
              is a specialized striato-pallidal basal ganglia nucleus that
              contains two pallidal cell types as well as the same four cell
              types found in the mammalian striatum. We recorded 185 single
              units in Area X of singing juvenile birds and, based on
              singing-related firing patterns and spike waveforms, find six
              distinct cell classes--two classes of putative pallidal neuron
              that exhibited a high spontaneous firing rate (> 60 Hz), and four
              cell classes that exhibited low spontaneous firing rates
              characteristic of striatal neurons. In this study, we examine in
              detail the four putative striatal cell classes. Type-1 neurons
              were the most frequently encountered and exhibited sparse
              temporally precise singing-related activity. Type-2 neurons were
              distinguished by their narrow spike waveforms and exhibited
              brief, high-frequency bursts during singing. Type-3 neurons were
              tonically active and did not burst, whereas type-4 neurons were
              inactive outside of singing and during singing generated long
              high-frequency bursts that could reach firing rates over 1 kHz.
              Based on comparison to the mammalian literature, we suggest that
              these four putative striatal cell classes correspond,
              respectively, to the medium spiny neurons, fast-spiking

  abstract = "In birds the entopallium (formerly known as the core region of
              ectostriatum) is the major thalamorecipient zone, within the
              telencephalon, of the tectofugal visual system. Here we sought to
              redefine the entopallium in the zebra finch, particularly with
              respect to a laterally adjacent zone, known as the
              perientopallium (formerly known as the periectostriatal belt),
              and to determine its projections. We show that the entopallium
              can be defined by the almost complete overlap of dense
              terminations of thalamic rotundal afferents and intense
              cytochrome oxidase activity and parvalbumin immunoreactivity. The
              perientopallium, on the other hand, can be defined by relatively
              sparse projections from nucleus rotundus, a calretinin-positive
              plexus of nerve fibers, and weak cytochrome oxidase activity and
              parvalbumin immunoreactivity. Within the entopallium, medial and
              lateral parts can be distinguished on the basis of cell packing
              density, differential patterns of parvalbumin immunoreactivity
              and cytochrome oxidase activity, and different projections. We
              show that the entopallium projects laterally and diffusely to the
              perientopallium and nidopallium (formerly the neostriatum) and
              specifically and densely to a teardrop-shaped nucleus in the
              ventrolateral mesopallium (formerly known as the hyperstriatum
              ventrale), here called MVL (abbreviation used as a proper name).
              This latter projection arises predominantly from medial parts of
              the entopallium, which also receives a reciprocal projection from
              MVL, and projects to the lateral striatum. These findings suggest
              that the entopallium can be divided into medial and lateral parts
              having different functions, one of which is to provide for an
              extratelencephalic outflow from the medial part, via the lateral
              striatum. The findings also challenge the idea that informational
              flow through the various stations of the telencephalic tectofugal
              visual system is largely sequential and, together with findings
              in the chicken (Alpar and T{\"o}mb{\"o}l), suggest instead that
              further substantial projections to telencephalic visual areas in
              birds can arise independently from both E (entopallium) and Ep

              their own sounds to the song of a tutor, young songbirds
              gradually converge to a stable song that can be a remarkably good
              copy of the tutor song. Here we show that vocal variability in
              the learning songbird is induced by a basal-ganglia-related
              circuit, the output of which projects to the motor pathway via
              the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium (LMAN). We
              found that pharmacological inactivation of LMAN dramatically
              reduced acoustic and sequence variability in the songs of
              juvenile zebra finches, doing so in a rapid and reversible
              manner. In addition, recordings from LMAN neurons projecting to
              the motor pathway revealed highly variable spiking activity
              across song renditions, showing that LMAN may act as a source of
              variability. Lastly, pharmacological blockade of synaptic inputs
              from LMAN to its target premotor area also reduced song
              variability. Our results establish that, in the juvenile
              songbird, the exploratory motor behavior required to learn a

              acquisition but not for the production of learned song in zebra
              finches. It has been shown that the anterior forebrain pathway
              sequentially connects the following nuclei: the high vocal
              center, area X of lobus parolfactorius, the medial portion of the
              dorsolateral thalamic nucleus, the lateral magnocellular nucleus

              X, forming a feedback loop within the anterior forebrain pathway.

              adult male canaries whose song had been previously recorded and
              analysed on a sound spectrograph. After several days of
              postoperative recording, the birds were sacrificed and their
              brains processed histologically for degeneration staining with
              the Fink-Heimer technique. Although large lesions in the
              neostriatum and rostral hyperstriatum had no effect on song,
              severe song deficits followed damage to a discrete large-celled
              area in the caudal hyperstriatum ventrale (HVc). Degenerating
              fibers were traced from this region to two other discrete nuclei
              in the forebrain: one in the parolfactory lobe (area X, a
              teardrop-shaped small-celled nucleus); and a round large-celled
              nucleus in the archistriatum (RA). Unilateral lesion of X had no
              effect on song; lesions of RA, however, caused severe song
              deficits. Degenerating fibers from RA joined the
              occipitomesencephalic tract and had widespread ipsilateral
              projections to the thalamus, nucleus intercollicularis of the
              midbrain, reticular formation, and medulla. It is of particular
              interest that direct connections were found onto the cells of the

              production. Unilateral lesions of n. intercollicularis
              (previously implicated in the control of vocal behavior) had
              little effect on song. One bilateral lesion of HVc resulted in
              permanent (9 months) and complete elimination of the audible
              components of song, although the bird assumed the posture and
              movements typical of song. Preliminary data suggest that lesions
              of the left hemisphere result in greater deficits than lesions of
              the right one. This finding is consistent with earlier reports
              that the left syrinx controls the majority of song components.

  abstract = "In songbirds, as in mammals, basal ganglia-forebrain circuits are
              necessary for the learning and production of complex motor
              behaviors; however, the precise role of these circuits remains
              unknown. It has recently been shown that a basal
              ganglia-forebrain circuit in the songbird, which projects
              directly to vocal-motor circuitry, has a premotor function
              driving exploration necessary for vocal learning. It has also
              been hypothesized that this circuit, known as the anterior
              forebrain pathway (AFP), may generate an instructive signal that
              improves performance in the motor pathway. Here, we show that the
              output of the AFP directly implements a motor correction that
              reduces vocal errors. We use disruptive auditory feedback,
              contingent on song pitch, to induce learned changes in song
              structure over the course of hours and find that reversible
              inactivation of the output of the AFP produces an immediate
              regression of these learned changes. Thus, the AFP is involved in
              generating an error-reducing bias, which could increase the
              efficiency of vocal exploration and instruct synaptic changes in
              the motor pathway. We also find that learned changes in the song
              generated by the AFP are incorporated into the motor pathway
              within 1 day. Our observations support a view that basal
              ganglia-related circuits directly implement behavioral
              adaptations that minimize errors and subsequently stabilize these

              substrates for vocal production and for auditory memory. In adult
              songbirds, the caudal pallium, the avian equivalent of the
              auditory association cortex, has been proposed to contain the
              neural substrate of tutor song memory, while the song system is
              involved in song production as well as sensorimotor learning. If
              this hypothesis is correct, there should be neuronal activation
              in the caudal pallium, and not in the song system, while the
              young bird is hearing the tutor song. We found increased
              song-induced molecular neuronal activation, measured as the

              juvenile zebra finch males that were in the process of learning

              'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between
              multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems,
              on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option,
              against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might
              turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for
              improving future decisions). Far from representing idle
              curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to
              discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In
              appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned
              by computational reinforcement learning (RL) theory, indicates
              that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network
              mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration
              has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological
              perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we
              show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be
              characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for
              addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this

              region necessary for the production of learned vocalizations.
              Previous studies have demonstrated that neuron addition to HVC is
              highest when song is most variable: in juveniles during song
              learning, in seasonally singing adults during peaks in plasticity
              that precede the production of new song components, or during
              seasonal reestablishment of a previously learned song. These
              findings suggest that neuron addition provides motor flexibility
              for the transition from a variable song to a target song. Here we
              test the association between the quality of song structure and
              HVC neuron addition by experimentally manipulating syringeal
              muscle control with Botox, which produces a transient partial

              neurons added to HVC. Birds with naturally high rates of neuron
              addition may have had the greatest success in recovering song.
              Alternatively, or in addition, new neuron survival in the song
              motor pathway may be regulated by the quality of song-generated
              feedback as song regains its original stereotyped structure.

              mechanisms of memory formation. Most of these advances stemmed

              the localized infusion of drugs with specific molecular actions
              into specific brain regions. This approach has revealed brain
              structures involved in different memory types and the main
              neurotransmitter systems and sequence of metabolic cascades that
              participate in memory consolidation. Biochemical studies and, in
              several cases, studies of genetically manipulated animals, in
              which receptors or enzymes affected by the various drugs were
              absent or overexpressed, have complemented the pharmacological
              research. Although most studies have concentrated on the
              involvement of the hippocampus, many have also investigated the
              entorhinal cortex, other regions of the cortex, and the amygdala.
              Behavioural pharmacology has been of crucial importance in
              establishing the major neurohumoral and hormonal systems involved
              in the modulation of memory formation. These systems act on
              specific steps of memory formation in the hippocampus and in the
              entorhinal, parietal, and cingulate cortex. A specialized system
              mediated by the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, and involving
              several neuromodulatory systems, is activated by emotional
              arousal and serves to regulate memory formation in other brain
              regions. The core mechanisms involved in the formation of
              explicit (declarative) memory are in many respects similar to
              those of long-term potentiation (LTP), particularly in the
              hippocampus. However, there are also important differences
              between memory formation and LTP. Memory formation involves
              numerous modulatory influences, the co-participation of various
              brain regions other than the hippocampus, and some properties
              that are specific to memory and absent in LTP (i.e. flexibility
              of response). We discuss the implications of these similarities
              and differences for understanding the neural bases of memory.",

              that remains below threshold for behavioural relevance. An
              alternative hypothesis is that such variation enables
              trial-and-error learning, in which the motor system generates
              variation and differentially retains behaviours that give rise to
              better outcomes. Here we test the latter possibility for adult
              bengalese finch song. Adult birdsong is a complex, learned motor
              skill that is produced in a highly stereotyped fashion from one
              rendition to the next. Nevertheless, there is subtle
              trial-by-trial variation even in stable, 'crystallized' adult
              song. We used a computerized system to monitor small natural
              variations in the pitch of targeted song elements and deliver
              real-time auditory disruption to a subset of those variations.
              Birds rapidly shifted the pitch of their vocalizations in an
              adaptive fashion to avoid disruption. These vocal changes were
              precisely restricted to the targeted features of song. Hence,
              birds were able to learn effectively by associating small
              variations in their vocal behaviour with differential outcomes.
              Such a process could help to maintain stable, learned song
              despite changes to the vocal control system arising from ageing
              or injury. More generally, our results suggest that residual
              variability in well learned skills is not entirely noise but
              rather reflects meaningful motor exploration that can support
              continuous learning and optimization of performance.",

              evaluation, suggesting that they proceed through a reinforcement
              learning (RL) mechanism. Songbirds have emerged as a model system
              to study how a complex behavioral sequence can be learned through
              an RL-like strategy. Interestingly, like motor sequence learning
              in mammals, song learning in birds requires a basal ganglia
              (BG)-thalamocortical loop, suggesting common neural mechanisms.
              Here, we outline a specific working hypothesis for how
              BG-forebrain circuits could utilize an internally computed
              reinforcement signal to direct song learning. Our model includes
              a number of general concepts borrowed from the mammalian BG

              dopamine-mediated plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. We also
              invoke a number of conceptual advances arising from recent
              observations in the songbird. Specifically, there is evidence for
              a specialized cortical circuit that adds trial-to-trial
              variability to stereotyped cortical motor programs, and a role
              for the BG in ``biasing'' this variability to improve behavioral
              performance. This BG-dependent ``premotor bias'' may in turn
              guide plasticity in downstream cortical synapses to consolidate
              recently learned song changes. Given the similarity between
              mammalian and songbird BG-thalamocortical circuits, our model for

              consolidation in the learning of a broad range of behaviours.
              During sleep, brain regions are reactivated, and specific
              patterns of neural activity are replayed, consistent with
              patterns observed in previous waking behaviour. Birdsong learning
              is a paradigmatic model system for skill learning. Song
              development in juvenile zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) is
              characterized by sleep-dependent circadian fluctuations in
              singing behaviour, with immediate post-sleep deterioration in
              song structure followed by recovery later in the day. In sleeping
              adult birds, spontaneous bursting activity of forebrain premotor
              neurons in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) carries
              information about daytime singing. Here we show that, in juvenile
              zebra finches, playback during the day of an adult 'tutor' song
              induced profound and tutor-song-specific changes in bursting
              activity of RA neurons during the following night of sleep. The
              night-time neuronal changes preceded tutor-song-induced changes
              in singing, first observed the following day. Interruption of
              auditory feedback greatly reduced sleep bursting and prevented
              the tutor-song-specific neuronal remodelling. Thus, night-time
              neuronal activity is shaped by the interaction of the song model
              (sensory template) and auditory feedback, with changes in
              night-time activity preceding the onset of practice associated
              with vocal learning. We hypothesize that night-time bursting
              induces adaptive changes in premotor networks during sleep as
              part of vocal learning. By this hypothesis, adaptive changes
              driven by replay of sensory information at night and by
              evaluation of sensory feedback during the day interact to produce
              the complex circadian patterns seen early in vocal development.",

              essential for vocal learning. We have examined the activity of
              identified HVC neurons of zebra finches during singing.
              Antidromic activation was used to identify three classes of HVC
              cells: neurons projecting to the premotor nucleus RA, neurons
              projecting to area X in the AFP, and putative HVC interneurons.
              HVC interneurons are active throughout the song and display tonic
              patterns of activity. Projection neurons exhibit highly phasic
              stereotyped firing patterns. X-projecting (HVC((X))) neurons
              burst zero to four times per motif, whereas RA-projecting neurons
              burst extremely sparsely--at most once per motif. The bursts of
              HVC projection neurons are tightly locked to the song and

              different and uncorrelated time scales. We test whether HVC((X))

  abstract = "The song system, a neural network that mediates the learning and
              production of song by oscine songbirds, is investigated
              extensively as a model system for understanding the neural basis
              of complex skill learning. Part of the complexity of birdsong
              arises from the coordinated recruitment of multiple groups of
              muscles on both sides of the body. Although the song system is
              bilaterally organized, little is known about how premotor
              activities on the two sides are coordinated during singing. We
              investigated this by unilaterally recording neural activity in
              the forebrain song nucleus HVc (also known as the high vocal
              center) during singing and by forcing the premotor activities in
              the two hemispheres out of synchrony by perturbing neural
              activity in the contralateral HVc with electrical stimulation.
              Perturbing the activity in one HVc at any time during a song led
              to a short-latency readjustment of activity in the contralateral
              HVc. This readjustment consisted of a true resetting of the
              temporal pattern of activity in the contralateral HVc rather than
              merely a transient activity suppression overlaid on an unaltered
              pattern of premotor activity. These results strongly suggest that
              the output of song premotor areas in the forebrain is
              continuously monitored and that an active mechanism exists for
              resynchronizing the outputs from the two hemispheres whenever

              innervate a basal ganglia pathway necessary for vocal plasticity,

              song motor signals in the two outputs of HVC and account for some
              of the song playback-evoked inhibition in HVC(X) cells.
              Furthermore, single interneurons made divergent connections onto
              PNs of both types, and either PN type could form reciprocal
              connections with interneurons. In these two regards, the synaptic
              architecture of HVC resembles that described in some

              MNs to learned vocalizations, little is known about their
              intrinsic electrical properties or their synaptic inputs.
              Therefore, we made in vitro and in vivo intracellular recordings

              intrinsic properties and their synaptic modulation by respiratory
              and telencephalic areas. In vitro, electrical stimulation of
              ipsilateral or contralateral medullary respiratory areas (RAm)

              With inhibition blocked, similar stimulation evoked excitatory
              synaptic responses capable of driving sustained MN firing that
              was mediated partly by NMDA receptors. These inhibitory and

              onset, but IPSPs were not apparent during inspiration, although

              ``motor acuity,'' quantified as a shift in the speed-accuracy
              trade-off function for a task. These shifts are primarily driven
              by reductions in movement variability. To determine the neural
              correlates of improvement in motor acuity, we devised a motor
              task compatible with magnetic resonance brain imaging that
              required subjects to make finely controlled wrist movements under
              visual guidance. Subjects were imaged on day 1 and day 5 while
              they performed this task and were trained outside the scanner on
              intervening days 2, 3, and 4. The potential confound of
              performance changes between days 1 and 5 was avoided by
              constraining movement time to a fixed duration. After training,
              subjects showed a marked increase in success rate and a reduction
              in trial-by-trial variability for the trained task but not for an
              untrained control task, without changes in mean trajectory. The
              decrease in variability for the trained task was associated with
              increased activation in contralateral primary motor and premotor
              cortical areas and in ipsilateral cerebellum. A global

              magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN). In most
              respects, LMAN lesions stabilized song to a significantly greater
              extent than did aging; whereas old-deafened birds eventually
              exhibited significant deterioration of song, lesioned-deafened
              birds generally did not differ from controls. The one exception
              was for song tempo, which was significantly stabilized by age,
              but not by LMAN lesions. The results indicate that LMAN lesions
              do not simply mimic a normal aging process, and likewise suggest
              that the anterior forebrain pathway continues to play a role even
              in the residual song plasticity that is observed after the
              age-dependent stabilization of song.",

  abstract = "Learning motor skills evolves from the effortful selection of
              single movement elements to their combined fast and accurate
              production. We review recent trends in the study of skill
              learning which suggest a hierarchical organization of the
              representations that underlie such expert performance, with
              premotor areas encoding short sequential movement elements
              (chunks) or particular component features (timing/spatial
              organization). This hierarchical representation allows the system
              to utilize elements of well-learned skills in a flexible manner.
              One neural correlate of skill development is the emergence of
              specialized neural circuits that can produce the required
              elements in a stable and invariant fashion. We discuss the
              challenges in detecting these changes with fMRI.",

  title    = "Social performance reveals unexpected vocal competency in young

  author   = "Kojima, Satoshi and Doupe, Allison J",
  abstract = "Vocal ontogeny in songbirds provides a good model for
              understanding how complex motor behavior, including speech, is
              learned. For birdsong, as for other motor learning, it has
              generally been assumed that a subject's motor output at any point
              during learning represents what the subject has learned to
              produce by that time. Here, we show, however, that juvenile zebra
              finches partway through song learning, singing immature song, are
              capable of producing song with much more mature properties,
              depending on the behavioral context. In these birds, we were able
              to elicit courtship (female-directed) song, which young birds
              normally sing infrequently, and to compare it with the alone or
              ``undirected'' song (Undir) predominantly produced during
              learning as well as with the same bird's subsequent adult song.
              We found that the juvenile courtship song was much less variable
              than the immature Undir and as stereotyped as the adult song
              produced after a further month of practice. More strikingly, the
              juvenile courtship song was also acoustically much more similar
              than Undir to the adult song. This finding demonstrates that the
              Undir that juvenile birds usually produce underestimates the
              extent of learning and that song structure is learned faster than
              previously thought. Moreover, the rapid improvement in song
              quality in response to external social cues supports the idea
              that courtship singing is a state of motor ``performance,'' in
              which the bird selects the best variants of the song learned
              during singing alone, and suggests that such performance states
              can reveal unappreciated progression of learning.",
